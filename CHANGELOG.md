# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New

- **6 analysis commands** for codebase-level insights:
  - `mix reach.coupling` — module-level coupling metrics (afferent/efferent
    coupling, Martin's instability metric, circular dependency detection).
    `--graph` renders the module dependency graph via boxart.
  - `mix reach.hotspots` — functions ranked by complexity × caller count,
    surfacing the highest-risk refactoring targets.
  - `mix reach.depth` — functions ranked by dominator tree depth (control
    flow nesting). `--graph` renders the CFG of the deepest function.
  - `mix reach.effects` — effect classification distribution across the
    codebase and top unclassified calls. `--module` restricts to one module.
  - `mix reach.xref` — cross-function data flow via the system dependence
    graph (parameter, return, state, and call edges between functions).
  - `mix reach.concurrency` — Task.async/await pairing, process monitors,
    spawn/link chains, and supervisor topology.
- **Plugin `classify_effect/1` callback** — plugins can now teach the
  effect classifier about framework-specific calls. Implemented for all
  6 built-in plugins (Phoenix, Ecto, Oban, GenStage, Jido, OpenTelemetry).

### Improved

- **Field access detection** — `socket.assigns`, `conn.params`, `state.count`
  are now recognized as field access (`kind: :field_access`) instead of
  remote calls with a fake module name. Classified as `:pure`.
- **Compile-time noise filtering** — `@doc`, `@spec`, `@type`, `use`,
  `import`, `alias`, `require`, `::`, `__aliases__`, typespec names, and
  binary syntax are classified as `:pure` instead of `:unknown`.
- **Local function effect inference** — after building the project graph,
  Reach walks all function bodies and infers effects from their callees.
  Functions that only call pure functions are classified as pure. This
  propagates transitively via fixed-point iteration.
- **Expanded pure modules** — `Access`, `Calendar`, `Date`, `DateTime`,
  `NaiveDateTime`, `Time` added. `Kernel.to_string` and other builtins
  now classified correctly when module is explicit.
- **`Enum.each` classified as `:io`** — previously fell through to
  `:unknown` despite being in `@effectful_in_pure_modules`.
- **`Application.get_env` classified as `:read`**.
- **Phoenix plugin**: route helpers (`*Routes`, `*.VerifiedRoutes`) → `:pure`.
- **Ecto plugin**: Repo reads → `:read`, Repo writes → `:write`, query DSL
  and changeset/schema macros → `:pure`.
- **Oban plugin**: `Oban.insert` → `:write`.
- **GenStage plugin**: `GenStage.call/cast` → `:send`, Broadway message
  transforms → `:pure`.
- **Jido plugin**: updated to v2 API. Signal dispatch → `:send`, directives
  → `:io`/`:send`, AgentServer → `:send`/`:read`, Thread → `:pure`.
- **OpenTelemetry plugin**: Tracer spans/attributes → `:io`, context
  operations → `:read`/`:write`, `:telemetry.execute` → `:io`.
- Unknown call ratio dropped from **~89% to ~20%** across real codebases
  (Plausible, Livebook, Ecto, Oban). With plugins active: ~18% Plausible.
- Upgraded boxart to 0.3.1.

## 1.4.1

### Fixed

- `mix reach.modules`, `mix reach.impact`, and `mix reach.slice` crash with
  `BadBooleanError` when `--graph` is not passed (closes #6).

## 1.4.0

### New

- **Terminal graph rendering** via optional `boxart` dependency:
  - `mix reach.graph Mod.fun/arity` — control flow graph with syntax-highlighted
    source code and line numbers in each node
  - `mix reach.graph Mod.fun/arity --call-graph` — callee tree as mindmap
  - `mix reach.deps Mod.fun/arity --graph` — callee tree visualization
  - `mix reach.impact Mod.fun/arity --graph` — caller tree visualization
  - `mix reach.modules --graph` — module dependency graph (internal only)
  - `mix reach.otp --graph` — GenServer state diagrams per module
  - `mix reach.slice file:line --graph` — slice subgraph

### Improved

- CFG rendering reuses `Visualize.ControlFlow.build_function/2` — same
  line ranges, block merging, and source extraction as the HTML visualization
- Graph output clamped to terminal width via `Boxart.render max_width`
- CFG code blocks dedented to match HTML visualization indentation
- Same-line CFG vertices merged (no more duplicate nodes)

## 1.3.0

### New

- **8 mix tasks for code analysis** — agent-oriented CLI tools that expose
  Reach's graph analysis as structured text/JSON output:
  - `mix reach.modules` — bird's-eye codebase inventory sorted by
    name/functions/complexity, with OTP/LiveView behaviour detection
  - `mix reach.dead_code` — find unused pure expressions (parallel per-file)
  - `mix reach.deps` — direct callers, callee tree, shared state writers
  - `mix reach.impact` — transitive callers, return value dependents, risk
  - `mix reach.flow` — taint analysis (`--from`/`--to`) and variable tracing
  - `mix reach.slice` — backward/forward program slicing by file:line
  - `mix reach.otp` — GenServer state machines, ETS/process dictionary
    coupling, missing message handlers, supervision tree
  - `mix reach.smell` — cross-function performance anti-patterns (redundant
    traversals, duplicate computations, eager patterns)
  - All tools support `--format text` (colored), `json`, and `oneline`
- **Dynamic dispatch in Elixir frontend** — `handler.(args)` and `fun.(args)`
  now emit `:call` nodes with `kind: :dynamic` (closes #4)
- **ANSI color output** — headers cyan, function names bright, file paths
  faint, complexity colored by severity, OTP state actions colored by type.
  Auto-disabled when piped.

### Fixed

- **BEAM frontend source_span normalization** — `:erl_anno` annotations
  (integer, `{line, col}` tuple, keyword list, or nil) now normalized via
  `:erl_anno.line/1` and `:erl_anno.column/1`. `start_line` is always integer
  or nil. Column info extracted from `{line, col}` tuples (closes #5).
- **Visualization crash on BEAM modules** — `build_def_line_map` and
  `cached_file_lines` now skip non-source files and validate UTF-8.
- **dead_code false positives reduced 91%** (628 → 58 on Phoenix) —
  fixed-point alive expansion for intermediate variables, branch-tail return
  tracing through case/cond/try/fn, guard exclusion, comprehension
  generator/filter exclusion, cond condition exclusion, `<>` pattern
  recognition, impure module blocklist (`Process`, `:code`, `:ets`, `Node`,
  `System`, etc.), typespec exclusion, impure call descendant marking.
- **reach.smell false positives** — structural pipe check instead of
  transitive graph reachability, per-clause redundant computation grouping,
  full argument comparison (vars + literals), type-check function exclusion,
  function reference filtering, callback purity check for map→map fusion.
- **reach.otp state detection** — finds struct field access (`state.field`),
  unwraps `%State{} = state` patterns, detects ETS writes through state
  parameter. No longer flags `Map.merge` on non-state variables.
- **reach.deps** shows only direct callers (transitive analysis in
  reach.impact).
- **Block quality** — `compute_vertex_ranges` uses `min_line_in_subtree` to
  include multi-line pattern children.

### Improved

- **Performance** — effect classification cached in ETS (shared across
  parallel tasks), SDG construction parallelized across modules.
  Livebook analysis: 9.7s → 3.5s.
- **Consistent CLI output** — `(none found)` everywhere, descriptive match
  descriptions (`name = Module.func is unused`), empty slice suggests
  `--forward`, zero-function modules filtered from reach.modules.

## 1.2.0

### New

- **Gleam support** — analyze `.gleam` source files with accurate line mapping.
  Uses the `glance` parser (Gleam’s own parser, written in Gleam) for native AST
  parsing with byte-offset spans. Supports case expressions, pattern matching with
  guards, pipes, anonymous functions, record updates, and all standard Gleam
  constructs. Requires `gleam build` and glance on the code path.

### Fixed

- Unreachable `block_label/5` catch-all clause removed (Dialyzer).
- `file_to_graph/2` cyclomatic complexity reduced — extracted `parse_file_and_build/3`
  and `read_and_build_elixir/2`.
- `func_end_line/2` simplified — extracted `find_nearest_end/2`.
- `apply/3` used for optional `:glance` module to avoid compile-time warnings.
- Empty blocks from line clamping filtered out in visualization.
- Exit nodes show label in Vue component (no more invisible gray bars).
- Block end_line uses max across all vertices (fixes multi-line heredoc coverage).
- Block overlap elimination — end_line clamping considers all blocks globally.
- `repo_module?/1` crash on capture syntax `& &1.name` (closes #3).

## 1.1.3

### Fixed

- Crash in `Reach.Plugins.Ecto.repo_module?/1` on capture syntax like
  `& &1.name` where call meta contains AST tuples instead of atoms (closes #3).
- Block end_line now uses max across all vertices in the block, fixing missing
  coverage for multi-line heredoc strings inside if/case branches.
- Block overlap elimination — end_line clamping now considers all blocks
  globally, not just the next one in traversal order (155 → 0 overlaps).
- Multi-clause dispatch functions now connect exit nodes via
  `find_exit_predecessors` instead of leaving them disconnected.

### Audited

16,047 functions across 1,213 files (Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, Oban, Plausible,
Livebook): 0 empty blocks, 0 nil labels, 0 overlaps, 0 duplicate lines,
0 missing exits, 0 disconnected exits.

## 1.1.2

### Fixed

- **Anonymous fn bodies inlined into parent CFG** — `Enum.reduce(fn ... end)`
  callbacks with internal branching (case/if/raise) are now decomposed into
  visible control flow blocks instead of being opaque single nodes.
- **Block merging for same-line nested constructs** — inline `if x, do: a, else: b`
  no longer creates monster merged blocks like `b_1490_1485_1489_1478`.
  Branch detection now includes clause targets and multi-out vertices.
- **Source extraction for clauses without source spans** — multi-clause function
  heads (e.g. `def foo(:join, :inner)`) that lack compiler source spans now show
  source code via child node line walking instead of empty gray blocks.
- **Block disjointness** — overlapping blocks eliminated (533 → 0) by clamping
  block end_line to `(next_block_start - 1)` and removing duplicate line ranges
  from dispatch clause blocks.
- **Missing exit nodes** — multi-clause dispatch functions now include proper
  exit nodes (58 missing → 0).
- **Pure pattern-matching dispatches** — functions like `join_qual/1` with 9
  one-line clauses render as a single function node instead of a useless
  dispatch → 9 disconnected clause blocks.
- **Preamble/sidebar spam removed** — the sidebar no longer shows `@doc`,
  `@moduledoc`, `use`, `import` lines extracted by string matching. Sidebar
  shows only module name and function list.
- **Render patterns** added for `:pin`, `:binary_op`, `:unary_op`, `:cons`,
  `:guard`, `:generator`, `:filter`, `:module_def` node types.

### Added

- **Block quality audit test** — validates 6 acceptance criteria (coverage,
  disjointness, no empty blocks, no nil labels, entry/exit structure) across
  real codebases (Ecto, Phoenix, Oban).

## 1.1.1

### Fixed

- Crash (`FunctionClauseError`) on macro definitions that look like `if/unless`
  calls with non-keyword-list branches (e.g. `defmacro if(condition, clauses)`
  in Elixir's own `Kernel`).
- Crash when `case/cond/receive` do-blocks contain `unquote` splices instead
  of a normal clause list (macro-heavy code like `Macro`, `ExUnit.Callbacks`).
- `hd([])` crash in control-flow builder on code with empty exit sets
  (e.g. single-clause `cond do true -> :ok end`).
- Struct/map pattern rendering crash with field bindings (from PR #2).

### Tested

Smoke-tested on 3,024 files across 8 major Elixir projects with zero failures:
elixir, phoenix, ecto, oban, plausible, livebook, blockscout, firezone.

## 1.1.0

### New

- **Plugin system** — `Reach.Plugin` behaviour for library-specific analysis.
  Auto-detects Phoenix, Ecto, Oban, GenStage, Jido, and OpenTelemetry at
  runtime. Override with `plugins:` option.
- **`mix reach` task** — generates self-contained interactive HTML report with
  three visualization modes: Control Flow, Call Graph, and Data Flow.
- **Expression-level control flow graph** — source-primary visualization where
  every line of every function is visible. Branch points (if/case/unless) show
  fan-out edges, all paths converge at merge points with blue converge edges.
- **Core CFG expansion** — Reach.ControlFlow.build/1 now correctly expands
  branches nested inside pipes, assignments, and calls. `if ... end |> f()`
  shows both branches converging at the pipe call.
- **Intra-function data flow** — Data Flow tab shows variable def→use chains
  within each function, labeled with variable names.
- **Module preamble** — sidebar shows `use`/`import`/`alias`/`@attributes` as
  a collapsed header, not separate nodes.
- **Syntax highlighting** — Makeup-powered server-side highlighting in all
  code blocks, with proper indentation preservation via common-prefix dedent.
- **Multi-clause dispatch** — pattern-match dispatch nodes with colored
  clause edges for functions with multiple `def` heads.
- **6 built-in plugins**: Phoenix, Ecto, Oban, GenStage, Jido, OpenTelemetry.

### Improved

- **Call graph** — filtered Ecto query bindings, pipe operators, kernel ops,
  Ecto DSL macros; nil module resolved to detected module; deduplicated edges.
- **Text selection** — code blocks now allow text selection (`user-select: text`,
  nodes not draggable).
- **Sidebar navigation** — click scrolls and zooms to function, highlights all
  nodes of selected function with blue glow, dims others. Click background to
  clear.

### Fixed

- Crash on `key :start_line not found` when processing branch expressions.
- Node ID collisions in `Reach.Project` parallel file parsing (shared
  `:atomics` counter).
- Module name extraction fallback when path has no `lib/src` prefix.

## 1.0.0

First public release.

### Core analysis

- **Program Dependence Graph** — builds a graph capturing data and control
  dependencies for Elixir and Erlang source code. Every expression knows what
  it depends on and what depends on it.
- **Scope-aware data dependence** — variable definitions resolve through
  lexical scope chains. Variables in case clauses, fn bodies, and
  comprehensions don't leak to sibling scopes.
- **Binding role tracking** — pattern variables (`x` in `x = foo()`, `{a, b}`)
  are tagged as definitions at IR construction time. Data edges go from
  definition vars to use vars, not from clauses.
- **Match binding edges** — `z = x ++ y` creates `:match_binding` edges from
  the RHS expression to the LHS definition var, enabling transitive data flow
  through assignments.
- **Containment edges** — parent expressions depend on their child
  sub-expressions. `backward_slice(x + 1)` reaches both `x` and `1`.
- **Multi-clause function grouping** — `def foo(:a)` + `def foo(:b)` in the
  same module are merged into one function definition with proper dispatch
  control flow (`:clause_match` / `:clause_fail` edges).

### Three frontends

- **Elixir source** — `Reach.string_to_graph/2`, `Reach.file_to_graph/2`.
  Handles all Elixir constructs: match, case, cond, with/else, try/rescue/after,
  receive/timeout, for comprehensions, pipe chains (desugared), capture
  operators (`&fun/1`, `&Mod.fun/1`, `&(&1 + 1)`), `if`/`unless` (desugared
  to case), guards, anonymous functions, structs, maps, dot access on variables.
- **Erlang source** — `Reach.string_to_graph(source, language: :erlang)`,
  auto-detected for `.erl` files. Parses via `:epp`, translates Erlang abstract
  forms to the same IR.
- **BEAM bytecode** — `Reach.module_to_graph/2`, `Reach.compiled_to_graph/2`.
  Analyzes macro-expanded code from compiled `.beam` files. Sees `use GenServer`
  injected callbacks, macro-expanded `try/rescue`, generated functions.

### Slicing and queries

- `Reach.backward_slice/2` — what affects this expression?
- `Reach.forward_slice/2` — what does this expression affect?
- `Reach.chop/3` — nodes on all paths from A to B.
- `Reach.independent?/3` — can two expressions be safely reordered? Checks
  data flow (including descendant nodes), control dependencies, and side effect
  conflicts.
- `Reach.nodes/2` — filter nodes by `:type`, `:module`, `:function`, `:arity`.
- `Reach.neighbors/3` — direct neighbors with optional label filter.
- `Reach.data_flows?/3` — does data flow from source to sink? Checks
  descendant nodes of both source and sink.
- `Reach.depends?/3`, `Reach.has_dependents?/2`, `Reach.controls?/3`.
- `Reach.passes_through?/4` — does the flow path pass through a node matching
  a predicate?

### Taint analysis

- `Reach.taint_analysis/2` — declarative taint analysis with keyword filters
  (same format as `nodes/2`) or predicate functions. Returns source, sink,
  path, and whether sanitization was found.

### Dead code detection

- `Reach.dead_code/1` — finds pure expressions whose values are never used and
  don't contribute to any observable output (return values or side-effecting
  calls). Excludes module attributes, typespecs, and vars (compiler handles
  those).

### Effect classification

- `Reach.pure?/1`, `Reach.classify_effect/1` — classifies calls as `:pure`,
  `:io`, `:read`, `:write`, `:send`, `:receive`, `:exception`, `:nif`, or
  `:unknown`.
- Hardcoded database covers 30+ pure modules (Enum, Map, List, String, etc.)
  plus Erlang equivalents.
- `Enum.each` correctly classified as impure.
- **Type-aware inference** — functions not in the hardcoded database are
  auto-classified by extracting `@spec` via `Code.Typespec.fetch_specs`.
  Functions returning only data types are inferred as pure; functions returning
  `:ok` are left as unknown.

### Higher-order function resolution

- Auto-generated catalog of 1,000+ functions from pure modules where parameters
  flow to return value. Covers Enum, Stream, Map, String, List, Keyword, Tuple,
  and Erlang equivalents.
- `:higher_order` edges connect flowing arguments to call results.
- Impure functions (like `Enum.each`) excluded — their param flow is for side
  effects, not return value production.

### Interprocedural analysis

- **Call graph** — `{module, function, arity}` vertices with call edges.
- **System Dependence Graph** — per-function PDGs connected through `:call`,
  `:parameter_in`, `:parameter_out`, and `:summary` edges.
- **Context-sensitive slicing** — Horwitz-Reps-Binkley two-phase algorithm
  avoids impossible paths through call sites.
- **Cross-module resolution** — `Reach.Project` links call edges across
  modules and applies external dependency summaries.

### OTP awareness

- **GenServer state threading** — `:state_read` edges from callback state
  parameter to uses, `:state_pass` edges between consecutive callback returns.
- **Message content flow** — `send(pid, {:tag, data})` creates
  `{:message_content, :tag}` edges to `handle_info({:tag, payload})` pattern
  vars. Tags must match.
- **GenServer.call reply flow** — `{:reply, value, state}` creates
  `:call_reply` edges from reply value back to `GenServer.call` call site.
- **ETS dependencies** — `{:ets_dep, table}` edges between writes and reads
  on the same table, with table name tracking.
- **Process dictionary** — `{:pdict_dep, key}` edges between `Process.put`
  and `Process.get` on the same key.
- **Message ordering** — `:message_order` edges between sequential sends to
  the same target pid.

### Concurrency analysis

- **Process.monitor → :DOWN** — `:monitor_down` edges from monitor calls to
  `handle_info({:DOWN, ...})` handlers in the same module.
- **trap_exit → :EXIT** — `:trap_exit` edges from `Process.flag(:trap_exit)`
  to `handle_info({:EXIT, ...})` handlers.
- **spawn_link / Process.link** — `:link_exit` edges to `:EXIT` handlers.
- **Task.async → Task.await** — `:task_result` edges paired by module scope
  and position order.
- **Supervisor children** — `:startup_order` edges from child ordering in
  `init/1`.

### Multi-file project analysis

- `Reach.Project.from_sources/2`, `from_glob/2`, `from_mix_project/1` —
  parallel file parsing, cross-module call resolution, merged project graph.
- `Reach.Project.taint_analysis/2` — taint analysis across all modules.
- `Reach.Project.summarize_dependency/1` — compute param→return flow summaries
  for compiled dependency modules.

### Canonical ordering

- `Reach.canonical_order/2` — sorts block children so independent siblings
  have deterministic order regardless of source order. Dependent expressions
  preserve relative order. Enables Type IV reordering-equivalent clone
  detection in ExDNA.

### Integration

- `Reach.ast_to_graph/2` — build graph from pre-parsed Elixir AST (for
  Credo/ExDNA integration, no re-parsing).
- `Reach.to_graph/1` — returns the underlying `Graph.t()` (libgraph) for
  power users who need path finding, subgraphs, BFS/DFS, etc.
- `Reach.to_dot/1` — Graphviz DOT export.
